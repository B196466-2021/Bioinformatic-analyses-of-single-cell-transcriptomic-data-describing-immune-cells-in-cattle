Tuberculosis (TB) is a recurrent respiratory infectious disease resulting from the human body becoming infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It continues to be a significant social and public health issue, seriously threatening people's health. Bovine tuberculosis (BTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is also a dangerous disease, causing approximately US$3 billion economic losses yearly. Both Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the human form, can cause tuberculosis in humans. The worldwide pandemic of tuberculosis has stimulated research into related treatments and vaccines. For the time being, Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) is a vaccine that is widely used worldwide to prevent tuberculosis, while the immunisation effect of BCG is not satisfactory. One drawback of BCG is that the vaccine protects against tuberculosis in children but not adults, suggesting that BCG does not induce long-term protection. Currently, researchers hope to improve the immune effect and memory of BCG or develop new vaccines to address this issue. This makes the study of the principle of BCG immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis an important research direction, which is the aim of this experiment. The immune response of BCG against tuberculosis is mainly initiated and controlled via the function of dendritic cells and macrophages. Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis is the first to infect alveolar macrophages and BCG exerts its immune effect in the presence of dendritic cells. 

## Introduction

In this experiment, a bovine model's immunological response induced by macrophages and dendritic cells will be the main subject because cattle are also partially protected by BCG and are good models for human disease and vaccine studies. The experimental results can also be applied to humans. The samples we studied were including both dendritic cells subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immune cells from whole lymph nodes. By using bioinformatics packages such as CellRanger (version 2.2.0) and Seurat (version 2.3.4) to analyze the single cell transcriptomic data, we compared differentially expressed genes in dendritic cells and macrophages after BCG injection. We also looked for the relevant cellular pathways affected using enrichment analysis. The experimental results can provide guidance and insights for subsequent research on tuberculosis control methods and the development of novel vaccines.
